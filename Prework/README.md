## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Notes

Swift and iOS development in general have steep learning curves. It took a while to understand how auto layout
and other features work in XCode, but once I got the hang of it, the rest fell into place pretty easily.
Many of the optional features were implemented on the last day to submit the prework, as I wanted to
make my submission as complete and fully-featured as possible.
